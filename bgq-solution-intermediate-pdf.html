                            <p> Hello everyone. My name is Jakub and I’ve been doing archery for around 4 years now. I’m by no means an expert but I’d like to share the knowledge I’ve gained over that time, often asking about things on this very subreddit. A lot of people here helped me in many cases so I thought it would be nice to give back to the community and do my part. Considering how often we get questions on how to pick up archery or what gear should one buy first, I thought we could use a guide summing some of those. BWF Progress Chart (https://i.imgur.com/mROfIRA.png) (this is version 1, see below for the latest) I was inspired by /u/3umel's "Bodyweight Skill Tree" post and the informative comments from a few days ago. At first I tried to improve their chart but then I realized I wanted something that included the intermediate steps in each progression and excluded the "legendary" skills that I will never attempt. I also decided to leave out prerequisites that span across progressions to simplify Decision: https://d3uwh8jpzww49g.cloudfront.net/sharedmedia/1510684/2064261_2019-03-29-order-granting-plaintiffs_-msj.pdf (https://d3uwh8jpzww49g.cloudfront.net/sharedmedia/1510684/2064261_2019-03-29-order-granting-plaintiffs_-msj.pdf) Highlights I enjoyed: gtThe Second Amendment does not exist to protect the right to bear down pillows and foam baseball bats.

The music industry, as big and lucrative it is, is not entirely transparent and rewarding for the key players that drive its economy - musicians and their fans. Many musicians are paid paltry sums as royalty from revenue generated from fans that stream their music. A larger part of the money is retained by the big companies and intermediate platforms hosting the musics. Solutions based on centralized technology have only capitalized on this to further rip artists off. Imusify is set to transfo. 
With the years of blockchain existence, its users have grown also and that makes it so much in use and wanted by so many parties and sectors. However, its stock still has so much to be set aright to make it more adaptable for users. Recently, blockchain has been so poor in the way they perform their functions and it has made blockchain lovers bear the consequences. Many platforms have emerged with aim of setting the balance and making the blockchain safer and effortless once more but haven't.

Warning : There will a small amount of math (but you can skip it). TL;DR: Ranking system based on rounds played on Ahoy/GT/VME/Webbies. ( Edit: I had an idea for how to make the intermediate weights in the math less extreme, which should get the system to not give the same number of points to lots of players, so expect changes.

This super-distribution system has become the foundation of our economy and wealth. The instant reduplication of data, ideas, and media underpins all the major economic sectors in our economy, particularly those involved with exports — that is, those industries where the US has a competitive advantage. Our wealth sits upon a very large device that copies promiscuously and constantly.
